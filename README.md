###Write Poetry with Guitar Hero and Chrome
Currently, Chrome is one of the only web browsers that supports game pads. So I thought, let's plug a guitar hero guitar into a laptop and make a little game to write poetry. The difficult part was perusing the local thrift stores to find an old, wired guitar hero guitar. Support isn't there yet for Mac/Linux so Windows 7+ Chrome is the only browser that this is work on. Make sure you plug in your guitar before opening up the webpage, just to be sure Chrome sees it's plugged in.

D3 (http://d3js.org/) is the JavaScript visualization library of choice. I'm using a circle that pulses in and out with colors that correspond to which fret to play.

##Gameplay
Strum the guitar at the correct time and a new word will appear in your own personal poem. At this time, I have a testing mode setup so that pressing any key on the keyboard is the same as strumming the guitar.

##Future Development
I'm looking to add music so the player can strum along to some sort of tempo rather than just watching a pulsating circle.
